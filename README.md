# Restocking Shopping Cart

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>This project can only be run by those who have the proper API installed from the course I am in, which is not part of this repo.  This program is meant to replicate putting items in a virtual shopping cart.  It pulls it's information from an API on localhost:8081.</p>

<h2>How to Run:</h2>
<p>After installing the files and running it on an HTTP server with node, you also have to run the other server on localhost:8081 with Strapi.</p>

<h2>Roadmap:</h2>
<p>I have noticed a problem with restocking multiple items, I'm not sure what causes it.  It looks like when items are returned, they are all put in the last restock.  If you then try to take items from the last restock, it multiplies the items.</p>
